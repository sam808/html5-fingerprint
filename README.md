html5-fingerprinting
============

HTML standalone application for creating and testing HTML5 fingerprinting

This was created to provide evidence in a study about the uniqueness of HTML5 "fingerprints"; feel
free to use however you see fit, either for real-world application of fingerprinting or for your own
studies of their usefulness.
